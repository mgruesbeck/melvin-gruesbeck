<h1 id="skeleton"><a href="http://getskeleton.com">Skeleton</a></h1>
<p>Skeleton is a simple, responsive boilerplate to kickstart any responsive project.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="http://getskeleton.com">http://getskeleton.com</a> for documentation and details.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>There are a couple ways to download Skeleton:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton/releases/download/2.0.4/Skeleton-2.0.4.zip">Download the zip</a></li>
<li>Clone the repo: <code>git clone https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton.git</code> (Note: this is under active development, so if you&#39;re looking for stable and safe, use the zipped download)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="whats-in-the-download">What&#39;s in the download?</h3>
<p>The download includes Skeleton&#39;s CSS, Normalize CSS as a reset, a sample favicon, and an index.html as a starting point.</p>
<pre><code>Skeleton/
├── index.html
├── css/
│   ├── normalize.min.css
│   └── skeleton.css
└── images/
    └── favicon.ico
</code></pre><h3 id="why-its-awesome">Why it&#39;s awesome</h3>
<p>Skeleton is lightweight and simple. It styles only raw HTML elements (with a few exceptions) and provides a responsive grid. Nothing more.</p>
<ul>
<li>Around 400 lines of CSS unminified and with comments</li>
<li>It&#39;s a starting point, not a UI framework</li>
<li>No compiling or installing...just vanilla CSS</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="browser-support">Browser support</h2>
<ul>
<li>Chrome latest</li>
<li>Firefox latest</li>
<li>Opera latest</li>
<li>Safari latest</li>
<li>IE latest</li>
</ul>
<p>The above list is non-exhaustive. Skeleton works perfectly with almost all older versions of the browsers above, though IE certainly has large degradation prior to IE9.</p>
